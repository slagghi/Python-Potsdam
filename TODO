 - Check whether I should implement the dropout layers, and how

 - Check the dimensionality of the output of the ReLU layers, and if it's compatible with conv and convt layers

 - Check if the dimensionality of each layer is compatible with the next

 - Try to understand how big the batch size should be, and if it matters

 - Download the dataset and feed a 65x65 patch to the CNN to see what happens
